## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

### Project Structure
- **Models** (`models.py`): Database schema and relationships
- **Routes** (`*.py` blueprint files): HTTP endpoints and business logic
- **Templates** (`templates/`): Jinja2 HTML templates organized by feature
- **Static Assets** (`static/`): CSS, JavaScript, and other assets
- **Messaging** (`messaging.py`, `messaging_clients.py`): Communication providers

### Database Changes
- Always create migrations for schema changes
- Test migrations on sample data before submitting
- Document any breaking changes in PR description

### Multi-Tenant Considerations
- All data operations must respect organization boundaries
- Test role-based permissions thoroughly
- Ensure proper data isolation between organizations
